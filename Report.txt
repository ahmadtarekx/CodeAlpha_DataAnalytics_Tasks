PROJECT REPORT: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) - BOOKS DATASET
DATE: December 8, 2025 AUTHOR: [Your Name] SUBJECT: Analysis of Book Inventory, Pricing, and Stock Distribution

SECTION 1: DATA STRUCTURE & QUALITY ASSESSMENT
Before analysis, the dataset was examined for structure and integrity.

DATA DIMENSIONS

The dataset consists of book records including Genre, Price, UPC, and Stock levels.

Total Rows: 190

Total Columns: 10

DATA CLEANING & ISSUES DETECTED

Redundancy: The columns 'Price', 'Price_Excl', and 'Price_Incl' were found to be identical. Analysis proceeded using only the 'Price' column.

Zero Variance: The 'Tax' column contained only 0.00 values, confirming this is a tax-free dataset (or tax is not recorded). This column was excluded to reduce noise.

Missing Information: The 'Review_Num' column was found to be empty/zero for all records, meaning customer sentiment analysis was not possible at this stage.

Useless Features: The 'Type' column contained only the value "Books" and was removed.

Cleaned the 'Price' Colomn to remove the $ sign 

Renamed the 'Status' colomn to 'Amount_Available' and shown only the amount in storage

SECTION 2: STRATEGIC BUSINESS QUESTIONS (EDA)
We analyzed four key business questions to understand inventory health.

Q1: PRICING STRATEGY

Question: Is there a significant price difference between genres?

Finding: The most expensive genre on average is Travel Books, while the most affordable is Religion.

Q2: INVENTORY EFFICIENCY

Question: Is there a relationship between Price and Stock levels?

Finding: We analyzed if expensive books are stocked in lower quantities. The correlation analysis suggests [No correlation].

Q3: MARKET CONCENTRATION (INVENTORY BALANCE)

Question: Is the inventory heavily skewed toward specific genres?

Finding: The inventory is [SKEWED]. The top 5 genres make up [55.2 %] of the total stock.

Q4: CAPITAL ALLOCATION

Question: Which books represent the highest tied-up capital?

Finding: High-value assets were identified by multiplying Price x Amount_Available. The single most valuable asset in stock is "Tipping The Velvet".

SECTION 3: STATISTICAL INSIGHTS & HYPOTHESIS TESTING
We tested statistical assumptions to validate the dataset.

OUTLIER DETECTION

Using box plots, we identified price outliers in the Romance category. These represent "Luxury" editions significantly above the average market price.

UPC UNIQUENESS

Hypothesis: Every book has a unique Universal Product Code (UPC).

Validation: The UPC column was checked for duplicates. [No duplicates were found]

SECTION 4: DATA VISUALIZATION PORTFOLIO
The following visualizations were created to communicate insights to stakeholders:

VISUAL 1: MARKET PRICE DISTRIBUTION (HISTOGRAM)

Purpose: To show the shape of book pricing in the market.

Insight: The majority of books fall in the price range of [20-50].

VISUAL 2: INVENTORY COMPOSITION (BAR CHART)

Purpose: To identify the top 10 genres by volume.

Insight: [Historical Fiction - Sequential Art - Romance - Fiction - Childrens] are dominant categories, suggesting these are the primary store focus.

VISUAL 3: PRICING STRATEGY BY GENRE (BOX PLOT)

Purpose: To compare price ranges and variability across genres.

Insight: This chart highlights which genres have stable pricing versus those with high variance.

VISUAL 4: INVENTORY RISK HEATMAP (SCATTER PLOT)

Purpose: To visualize the relationship between Price and Stock.

Insight: Helps identify high-risk items (High Price + High Stock) that may need discounting if they do not sell.

SECTION 5: CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the analysis:

The dataset required cleaning of redundant tax and price columns.

Pricing strategies vary significantly by genre.

RECOMMENDATION: Focus future restocking efforts on high-performing genres and consider discounting high-stock/high-price outliers identified in the Scatter Plot to free up capital.
