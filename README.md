# CodeAlpha_DataAnalytics_Tasks

TASK 1 (WEB SCRAPPING):

For my first task, I was tasked with web scraping data and formatting it for later analysis.
 Initially, I leaned towards coding the scraper myself, as I already have HTML knowledge and the desire for custom data manipulation using tools like Pandas. 
 However, I encountered several sites that actively blocked scraping attempts. 
 To overcome this, I adapted my approach and utilized the user-friendly tool, ParseHub,
  which allowed me to efficiently scrape the necessary data without further technical hurdles
